The executable file is there, the source code is the one with ".py" extension.

## how to run the code

you need FFmpeg as a pre-requisite

you could try installing via chocolatey(if you haven't had chocolatey, go to powershell as administrator and type in this command)

you know it is administrator if you see C:\WINDOWS\system32>

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

close powershell, open it up again, as administrator

now type the command:

```
choco install ffmpeg
```
